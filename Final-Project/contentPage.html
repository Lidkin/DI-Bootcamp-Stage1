            <h1>Why Horror?</h1>
            <p>Fairy tales like Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, or Sleeping Beauty, heard in early
                childhood,
                always ended well.
                But a lot changed when I learned to read and began visiting the library independently. In
                the
                village where I grew up,
                there was no censorship of literature by age, so I could choose whatever I wanted. Turned
                out that
                the original fairy
                tales are not so cute at all ... And it was scary ... exciting! From then began a
                fascinating
                passion for the worlds of
                horror and surrealism: Lafcraft, Stoker, King, Lynch, and many others. I want to introduce
                you here
                to some of my
                favorite works. Enjoy!</p>

                    'H.P.
                    Lovecraft's reputation has grown tremendously over the decades, and he is now commonly
                    regarded
                    as
                    one of the most important horror writers of the 20th century, exerting an influence that
                    is
                    widespread, though often indirect.'
                    <br>
                    H.P. Lovecraft's tales of the tentacled Elder God Cthulhu and his pantheon of alien
                    deities were
                    initially written for
                    the pulp magazines of the 1920s and '30s. These astonishing tales blend elements of
                    horror,
                    science
                    fiction and cosmic
                    terror that are as powerful today as they were when they were first published.

                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">Stephen Edwin King</a> (born September 21, 1947)
                    is an American author of horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, crime, science-fiction, and
                    fantasy novels. Described as the "King of Horror", his books have sold more than 350 million copies
                    as of 2006,
                    and many have been adapted into films, television series, miniseries, and comic books.
                    <br> King has published 64 novels,
                    including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman, and five non-fiction books.[4] He has also
                    written approximately 200
                    short stories, most of which have been published in book collections
                </p>

                <p> Among the King's books, this may be my favorite. This is a horror/fantasy novel, published in 1995.
                    It deals with the effects of domestic
                    violence (which King had touched upon before in the novels It, Insomnia, Dolores Claiborne, Needful
                    Things, and many
                    others) and, unusually for a King novel, relies for its fantastic element on Greek mythology. In his
                    memoir, On Writing,
                    King states that Rose Madder and Insomnia are "stiff, trying-too-hard novels."

                        <p>It (also known as Stephen King's IT) is a 1990 ABC two-part psychological horror
                            drama
                            miniseries
                            directed by Tommy
                            Lee Wallace and adapted by Lawrence D. Cohen from Stephen King's 1986 novel of the
                            same
                            name.
                            The story revolves around
                            a predatory monster that can transform itself into its prey's worst fears to devour
                            them,
                            allowing it to exploit the
                            phobias of its victims. It mostly takes the humanoid form of Pennywise, a darkly
                            comedic
                            clown.

                        <p>Clive Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of short stories, the Books of
                            Blood, which established him as a leading
                            horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works. His fiction has been
                            adapted into films, notably the
                            Hellraiser series, the first installment of which he also wrote and directed. <br>
                            When Books of Blood was first published in the United States in paperback, Stephen King was
                            quoted on the book covers:
                            "I have seen the future of horror and his name is Clive Barker." <br>
                            Cenobites are extra-dimensional beings who appear in the novella The Hellbound Heart, the
